Developed and demonstrated a limited-feature version of an Ethereum Smart Wallet that allows users to access their wallets using social media platforms (e.g., through OTPs), biometric authentication, and a passcode.

Steps:

1. Implementation:
   - User Authentication:
     - Integrated social media logins using OTPs, similar to the Web3Auth method of logging in via Google, Facebook, etc.
     - Implemented biometric authentication (fingerprint or facial recognition) for secure access to the wallet.
     - Included passcode protection for additional security.

   - Wallet Functionality:
     - Created a smart contract to manage wallet functionalities, including balance management, transaction handling, depositing, and withdrawing ETH.
     - Implemented functions to retrieve user wallet addresses, chain ID, and balance, reflecting the user info retrieval process demonstrated in the Web3Auth video.

   - User Interface:
     - Designed a responsive UI that adapts to user states (logged in/out), similar to the demo shown in the Web3Auth video.
     - Provided visual feedback for actions like loading states during authentication and transaction processing.

   - Code Structure:
     - Organized your project with clear files for authentication (e.g., `app.js`) and RPC interactions (e.g., `web3RPC`).
     - Included key functions for getting user info, chain ID, and balance, paralleling the outlined functions in the Web3Auth video for managing blockchain interactions.

   - State Management:
     - Used state management to track whether the user is connected or not, as demonstrated with the Web3Auth object.
     - Stored user session data securely, similar to how Web3Auth manages authentication states.

2. Video Demonstration:
   - Showcasing Functionality:
     - Created a video that demonstrates the functionalities of the smart wallet, including logging in, checking balance, and sending transactions, akin to the Web3Auth demo.
   
   - Code Explanation:
     - Included segments in your video where you explain the code structure and how each part contributes to the overall functionality of the wallet.

Conclusion:
By following these steps, we can create a secure and user-friendly Ethereum Smart Wallet that effectively integrates modern authentication methods with essential wallet functionalities.
